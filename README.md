## Installation

Create a copy of this [template repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/daily-briefings-py), then clone or download your new repo onto your local computer (for example to the Desktop), and navigate there from the command-line:

```sh
cd ~/Desktop/daily-briefings-py/
```

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "briefings-env":

```sh
conda create -n briefings-env python=3.8
conda activate briefings-env
```

Then, within an active virtual environment, install package dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Background Jobs

Printing today's weather forecast (to test the Weather.gov API):

```sh
python -m app.weather_service

# in production mode:
APP_ENV="production" COUNTRY_CODE="US" ZIP_CODE="20057" python -m app.weather_service
```


### Web Application

Running the web app (then view localhost:5000 in the browser):

```sh
# Mac OS:
FLASK_APP=web_app flask run

# Windows OS:
# ... if `export` doesn't work for you, try `set` instead
export FLASK_APP=web_app
flask run
```
